"""
This middleware can be used when a known proxy is fronting the application,
and is trusted to be properly setting the `X-Forwarded-Proto` and
`X-Forwarded-For` headers with the connecting client information.

Modifies the `client` and `scheme` information so that they reference
the connecting client, rather that the connecting proxy.
